We can use linkedilist or array  to store the result for factorial of large number 

Using array
    we can use two functions factorial() and multiply()

factorial()
 in this function we will iterate from 2 to n(the number of which we want factorial)
 for i=2 to n
 and then call multply(i, res_array, res_size)


multiply(int x,int res_array,int res_size)

 carry=0
loop from i=0 to res_size
product =res[i]*x+carry
res[i] = product/10;
carry = product %10;
end loop



while(carry)
{
   res[res_size] = carry%10;
   carry = carry/10;
   res_size++;
}

return res_size;
